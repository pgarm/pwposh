function Get-PasswordWeb {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    DEPRECATED as the PasswordPusher had been updated to properly return password over API.
    Pulls the password from public pwpush.com or a private instance of Password Pusher by using a full link.
    Uses generic HTTP web request for compatibility with older builds of pwpusher
    .DESCRIPTION
    This complements Peter Giacomo Lombardo's genius idea of sending a temporary link to password instead of plaintext (https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher).
    By default will work against publicly hosted instance at https://pwpush.com, but can use your privately hosted instance by specifying the target as script parameter.
    .NOTES
    Mostly useful in automation deferred password auth/use, e.g. domain join of prestaged computers.
    .PARAMETER Link
    Link to retrieve password from in full https://pwpush.com/p/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8 form. Will append .json automatically.
    Can be aliased as -l
    .PARAMETER Kill
    Delete the password from database (if allowed by pusher originally), False by default
    Can be aliased as -k
    .EXAMPLE
    $pwdlink | Get-PasswordWeb

    Pulls the password from the specified link.
